    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) chicken pieces (legs and thighs are traditional)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup vinegar (white or cane vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance the flavors)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, minced garlic, chopped onion, soy sauce, bay leaf, and
                    whole black peppercorns. Make sure the chicken is well-coated.</li>
                <li>Marinate for at least 30 minutes. For best results, marinate for a few hours or overnight in the
                    refrigerator.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large, deep skillet or pot, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and set the marinade aside.</li>
                <li>Sear the chicken pieces until they turn golden brown on all sides. This adds flavor to the dish.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Simmer the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the reserved marinade over the seared chicken.</li>
                <li>Add the vinegar and water. If you prefer a slightly sweeter adobo, add the optional sugar.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 to 40
                    minutes or until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. Stir occasionally.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season to Taste:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. The vinegar should provide
                    a tangy kick, and the soy sauce adds a rich, salty flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Pair it with steamed rice. You can also garnish it with fresh
        cilantro or green onions for extra flavor and a pop of color.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Chicken Adobo is even better when allowed to sit for a while, as the flavors deepen over
        time. It's a perfect make-ahead dish for gatherings or family meals.</p>
