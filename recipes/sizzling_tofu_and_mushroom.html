    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>250g firm tofu, cubed</li>
        <li>200g fresh mushrooms (shiitake, cremini, or your choice), sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or green onions for garnish</li>
        <li>Cooking oil for stir-frying</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tofu:</strong> Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess water. Cut it into bite-sized
            cubes and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sizzling Start:</strong> Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add a bit of cooking oil
            and let it heat up.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics Awaken:</strong> Toss in the minced garlic and grated ginger. Saut√© for about a minute
            until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Mushroom Magic:</strong> Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet. Stir-fry until they start to brown
            and release their savory aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Tofu Tango:</strong> Gently add the tofu cubes to the mushrooms. Cook until the tofu turns slightly
            golden and crispy on the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Pepper and Onion Parade:</strong> Introduce the thinly sliced red bell pepper and onion to the
            sizzling mixture. Continue stir-frying for a few more minutes until they become tender and vibrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce Symphony:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and
            red pepper flakes. Pour this delightful sauce over the sizzling ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Season to Perfection:</strong> Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Remember, a little goes a
            long way with soy sauce, so be cautious not to over-salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Sizzle:</strong> Let everything sizzle together for a few more minutes, allowing the flavors
            to meld and the sauce to coat the tofu, mushrooms, and veggies.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Transfer your sizzling tofu and mushroom creation to a serving platter.
            Garnish with fresh cilantro or green onions for a burst of color and flavor.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Pair it with steamed rice or noodles for a complete,
        satisfying meal that's sure to become a favorite in your vegetarian recipe repertoire.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Customize this recipe with your favorite vegetables or adjust the spiciness level by
        adding more or less red pepper flakes. It's a versatile dish that suits your preferences.</p>
